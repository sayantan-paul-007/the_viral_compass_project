Some changes to current module
V0
- The video analysed will be saved as an instance of the analysis, akin to chatgpt or any chatbased llm
- Add some more features that was proposed my me at the earliest stage
- This module will allows user to upload videos of a specific limit and size
- The analysis report should be an engaging one with a combination of diagrams and figures
- Make sure the same video will generate same result based on visual identification as same video can have multiple names
- In the previous model, the result was saved as md, now I will make the downloadable pdf format which will be downloadable 
- Login, logout via google auth
v1
- If necessary, we can add an agent that will be the person who tells the analysis as a normal person (least optional) 
- I will add the feature on what mode to think like 'as a normal person', 'as a video expert', 'as a film maker' and many more modes, the reason is that it will help make the report more different and i will assign various agents for that.
- Feed some Story telling frameworks that will make storytelling videos get more vivid idea about their content.
- All of these are probabilistic results and not a guaranteer of success as a normal person is also unable to figure out single handedly about the success or failure and results may contradict as well.
V2
- Add security layers 
- Make the design in such a way that it mimics the psychology of a content strategist
- Add demographic panel to give more demographic insight as to which country it might bloom
- Map and analyse the audience mentality based on the demographics
- Give and suggest most accurate platform friendly keywords for content excellence by collecting the keywords from the videos captions 
V3 - Major change
- Make it as a plugin and make it available to them to an additional notepad interface
